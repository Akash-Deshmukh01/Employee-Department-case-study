# Employee-Department-case-study

📌 Overview
This project is a business analysis case study focused on employee and department data, completed entirely using SQL. The goal was to extract, analyze, and interpret organizational data to generate insights about employee distribution, departmental performance, and resource allocation.

Joins & Relationships
Mapped and analyzed relationships between employee and department tables using various joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) to merge and relate datasets effectively.

SQL Clauses
Utilized WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, and LIMIT clauses to filter and structure the data for targeted analysis.

Aggregate Functions
Applied functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), and MIN() to understand department-wise salary distribution, headcount, and performance indicators.

Subqueries & Nested Queries
Used subqueries to find insights like employees earning above departmental averages and nested queries to perform layered data filtering and comparison.

🔍 Key Insights Derived
