# Employee-Department-case-study

📌 **Overview**

This project is a business analysis case study focused on employee and department data, completed entirely using SQL. The goal was to extract, analyze, and interpret organizational data to generate insights about employee distribution, departmental performance, and resource allocation.

🧰 **Skills & Concepts Applied**

1.**Joins & Relationships**
Mapped and analyzed relationships between employee and department tables using various joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) to merge and relate datasets effectively.

2.**SQL Clauses**
Utilized WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, and LIMIT clauses to filter and structure the data for targeted analysis.

3.**Aggregate Functions**
Applied functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), and MIN() to understand department-wise salary distribution, headcount, and performance indicators.

4.**Subqueries & Nested Queries**
Used subqueries to find insights like employees earning above departmental averages and nested queries to perform layered data filtering and comparison.

🔍 **Key Insights Derived**
1.Identified departments with the highest and lowest average salaries.

2.Analyzed employee count trends across departments.

3.Highlighted employees earning above their departmental average.

4.Tracked hiring patterns and employee distribution by job roles.

🎯 **Outcomes**
1.Helped simulate real-world business queries through structured analysis.

2.Showed how relational data models support analytical thinking.

3.Reinforced data-driven decision-making by uncovering hidden patterns.

4.Improved fluency in writing efficient, multi-layered SQL queries.
